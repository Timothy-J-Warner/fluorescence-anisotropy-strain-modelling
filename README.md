## About The Project

Please cite "Effect of luminescent nanocrystal alignment on fluorescence anisotropy and light guiding in polymer films"
when using this tool.
\
\
The project contains two scripts used to model the relationship between fluorescence anisotropy and true strain in 
polymer films containing fluorescent nanoplatelets. It was developed for the publication "Effect of 
luminescent nanocrystal alignment on fluorescence anisotropy and light guiding in polymer films". One is a script to 
model fluorescence anisotropy vs true strain data with an exponential model and the other models the same data with a 
series of linear models.
