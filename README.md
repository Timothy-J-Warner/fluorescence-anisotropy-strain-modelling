## About The Project

The project contains two scripts used to generate plots for the publication "Effect of luminescent nanocrystal 
alignment on fluorescence anisotropy and light guiding in polymer films". One is a script to model fluorescence
anisotropy vs true strain data with an exponential model the other models the same data with a series of linear models.

## Publication Details

- Title:"Effect of luminescent nanocrystal alignment on fluorescence anisotropy and light guiding in polymer films"
- Authors: Timothy Warner, Michael Rinaudo, Yang Xu, Jiho Han, Arun Ashokan, Nicholas Kirkwood, Asaph Widmer-Cooper,
